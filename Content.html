            <h2>My Personality</h2>
            <p>My personality is very outgoing, energetic and confident. 
            Whenever an opportunity arises to improve myself in something
             that I love, I will always take it without hesitation. 
             I always push my schedule to my limits with all the 
             different things I do, sometimes to my own regret. It’s hard
            to put all my effort into all my activities but my energetic 
              personality always pushes me through. The confidence in my
               personality is really shown when I’m given tasks that I think
            might be impossible. My confidence is the main thing that
             pushes me to do things I thought I could never do. It’s like
              the quote by Ronnie Lott “If you can believe it, 
              the mind can achieve it”.

            <h2>Growth vs Fixed Mindset</h2>
            <p>
                A fixed mindset essentially means that everything about you is “fixed” 
                and there is nothing you can do to change it. People decide that they 
                are as good as they will ever get and don’t work to improve themselves. 
                They believe that effort is not necessary to be successful. A growth 
                mindset on the other hand, is essentially the exact opposite. They 
                believe that skill is not given, but earned. They believed that if 
                you were not the smartest, strongest, most skilled person, with hard 
                work you could change. They also believe that you have to work for 
                success.

            <h2>Letter To My Future Self</h2>
            <p>
                Dear future me, I hope that you have been doing well, like I’ve planned 
                I guess. I hope that your baseball has taken you to a good american 
                college so you can get your engineering degree. Is your plan still to 
                move to San Francisco when you graduate? Or has the tech market moved 
                elsewhere?  Have you learnt any new coding languages or have you just 
                stuck to html and css? Have you started investing in stocks and bonds 
                yet or are you still broke? Did you end up living in a tiny apartment 
                by yourself or do you have roommates? I know you’ve always disliked 
                living with people. Before I end my letter, I have some advice for you, 
                or me, I guess. Don’t wait to do things. Don’t tell yourself that 
                you’ll do your essay in an hour. Don’t say you’ll fix your car tomorrow. 
                Fix it today. Write your essay now. The most successful people, the 
                people that companies want to hire, the people that other people want 
                to do business with don’t wait that extra day, that extra hour. They 
                do it now.
